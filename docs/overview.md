# System Overview

The Docker Cerebras demo showcases a sophisticated multi-agent system designed for Node.js programming assistance. Understanding the architecture and components will help you make the most of this workshop.

## System Architecture

!!! info "Multi-Agent Architecture"
    The system consists of three specialized agents orchestrated through Docker Compose, each with distinct roles and capabilities for comprehensive programming assistance.

### Agent Roles and Responsibilities

#### 🦆 DevDuck - The Coordinator

- **Model**: Jan-Nano (hf.co/menlo/jan-nano-gguf:q4_k_m)
- **Role**: Main development assistant and project coordinator
- **Capabilities**: Routes requests to appropriate sub-agents based on user needs
- **Function**: Acts as the central hub for user interactions

#### 💻 Local Agent - Development Expert

- **Model**: Lucy (hf.co/menlo/lucy-gguf:q8_0)
- **Role**: General development tasks and project coordination
- **Specialization**: Node.js programming expert for understanding code, explaining concepts, and generating code snippets
- **Function**: Handles standard development queries and code generation

#### 🧠 Cerebras Agent - Advanced Computing

- **Model**: Llama-4 Scout (llama-4-scout-17b-16e-instruct)
- **Provider**: Cerebras API
- **Specialization**: Complex Node.js problem-solving scenarios requiring advanced reasoning
- **Function**: Handles complex computational tasks and advanced problem-solving

## Docker Compose's Central Role

Docker Compose serves as the backbone of this multi-agent system:

### 🚀 Service Orchestration
- Manages the lifecycle of all three agents
- Handles startup and shutdown sequences  
- Ensures proper dependency management

### ⚙️ Configuration Management
- Defines agent prompts and behaviors
- Manages model configurations
- Sets service dependencies

### 🌐 Network Coordination
- Establishes secure inter-agent communication channels
- Creates isolated network environments
- Manages port mappings and exposure

### 🔐 Environment Management
- Handles API keys and secrets
- Manages model parameters
- Controls runtime configurations

## Key Features

1. **Multi-agent coordination**: Intelligent routing between specialized agents based on task requirements

2. **Node.js programming expertise**: All agents specialize in Node.js development with comprehensive knowledge

3. **FastAPI web interface**: RESTful API with intuitive web interface for seamless interaction

4. **Docker containerization**: Easy deployment and scaling with Docker Compose

5. **Flexible model configuration**: Support for multiple LLM providers (local and cloud) with easy configuration

6. **Token streaming**: Real-time response streaming for better user experience

## Use Cases and Applications

This system excels in scenarios requiring:

### 🔧 Development Tasks
- Code generation and explanation
- Project coordination and planning
- Code analysis and optimization
- Testing strategy development

### 🎓 Learning and Support  
- Educational programming assistance
